Preparing the remote plan...

The remote workspace is configured to work with configuration at
terraform/environments/dev relative to the target repository.

Terraform will upload the contents of the following directory,
excluding files or directories as defined by a .terraformignore file
at /home/runner/work/iac-tf/iac-tf/.terraformignore (if it is present),
in order to capture the filesystem context the remote workspace expects:
    /home/runner/work/iac-tf/iac-tf
